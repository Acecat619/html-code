 <p>You can refine your skills and improve your workflow with every<br> 
    task by applying your knowledge to practical experiences. The<br>
    skills you learn and apply are transferable,and they can increase<br>
    your marketability and advance your career by appealing to<br>
    potential employers.</p>  
    <p>You can also consider applying them independently to create<br>
    your own startup business.</p>

    <p>Many brands operate a relaxed dress policy (we do at ciphr for<br>
    office-based staff). You don't need to come to work everyday in<br>
    a 3-piece suit, just spruce ypurself up a bit with a casual shirt and<br>
    trouser.<br>The same goes for footwear, scruffy two year old trainers can be<br>
     replaced with a pair of casual shoes. </p>
     <p><b>Get social on and offline</b><br>Getting to know your colleagues socially is a great way to learn<br>
    how people tick, but also to strike up new friendships.<br>
    It's often the case that people will work better together if they<br>
    socialise as well. connecting with colleagues on social media<br>
    helps you and them to bond and becomes more cohesive as a<br>team.</p>
    <p><b>Be proactive and 'give it a go'</b></p>
    <p>Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone's a good way to learn<br>
    new skills and become more confident. speaking at the company meeting<br>
    attending customer events or meeting clients in person, whatever it is, offer<br>
    your services and don't wait to be asked, people will notice your pro-active<br> nature.</p> 
    <p>Offering yourself up for new challenges will also add variety into your daily<br>
     schedule, stimulating your creativity and giving you a break from the regular<br>routine.</p>

     <p>When you connect with others that share similar intrests in the<br>tech industr, you're 
    building professional network.<br>Attending local conferences, contributing to online tech forums<br>
     and talking to local professionals are all effective methods to<br> expand your tech industry connections.</p>
